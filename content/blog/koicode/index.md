## Project Overview

koiCode is a web-based platform which provides visual scripting & code visualization for beginners. This project was created as part of the Microsoft Image Cup. It features a complete visualization process for computer programs and the possibility to create methods with a visual scripting tool.

## The Journey

To showcase our software in the competition, we created a minimalistic prototype using plain JavaScript. As preparation for the world final, we then created a much more polished & usable version with technologies described below.

## Technology

The application was created using Node.js, React.js, PostgreSQL and a remote server to run & debug the programs which were created with our tool. A live version of our application was hosted on Azure using the Azure App Service and a virtual machine for the remote server.
